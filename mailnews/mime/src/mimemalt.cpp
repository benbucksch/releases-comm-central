  BACKGROUND
  ----------

  At the simplest level, multipart/alternative means "pick one of these and
  display it." However, it's actually a lot more complicated than that.

  The alternatives are in preference order, and counterintuitively, they go
  from *least* to *most* preferred rather than the reverse. Therefore, when
  we're parsing, we can't just take the first one we like and throw the rest
  away -- we have to parse through the whole thing, discarding the n'th part if
  we are capable of displaying the n+1'th.

  Adding a wrinkle to that is the fact that we give the user the option of
  demanding the plain-text alternative even though we are perfectly capable of
  displaying the HTML, and it is almost always the preferred format, i.e., it
  almost always comes after the plain-text alternative.

  Speaking of which, you can't assume that each of the alternatives is just a
  basic text/[whatever]. There may be, for example, a text/plain followed by a
  multipart/related which contains text/html and associated embedded
  images. Yikes!

  You also can't assume that there will be just two parts. There can be an
  arbitrary number, and the ones we are capable of displaying and the ones we
  aren't could be interspersed in any order by the producer of the MIME.

  We can't just throw away the parts we're not displaying when we're processing
  the MIME for display. If we were to do that, then the MIME parts that
  remained wouldn't get numbered properly, and that would mean, for example,
  that deleting attachments wouldn't work in some messages. Indeed, that very
  problem is what prompted a rewrite of this file into its current
  architecture.

  ARCHITECTURE
  ------------

  Parts are read and queued until we know whether we're going to display
  them. If the first pending part is one we don't know how to display, then we
  can add it to the MIME structure immediately, with output_p disabled. If the
  first pending part is one we know how to display, then we can't add it to the
  in-memory MIME structure until either (a) we encounter a later, more
  preferred part we know how to display, or (b) we reach the end of the
  parts. A display-capable part of the queue may be followed by one or more
  display-incapable parts. We can't add them to the in-memory structure until
  we figure out what to do with the first, display-capable pending part,
  because otherwise the order and numbering will be wrong. All of the logic in
  this paragraph is implemented in the flush_children function.

  The display_cached_part function is what actually adds a MIME part to the
  in-memory MIME structure. There is one complication there which forces us to
  violate abstrations... Even if we set output_p on a child before adding it to
  the parent, the ParseBegin function resets it. The kluge I came up with to
  prevent that was to give the child a separate options object and set
  output_fn to nullptr in it, because that causes ParseBegin to set output_p to
  false. This seemed like the least onerous way to accomplish this, although I
  can't say it's a solution I'm particularly fond of.

  Another complication in display_cached_part is that if we were just a normal
  multipart type, we could rely on MimeMultipart_ParseLine to notify emitters
  about content types, character sets, part numbers, etc. as our new children
  get created. However, since we defer creation of some children, the
  notification doesn't happen there, so we have to handle it
  ourselves. Unfortunately, this requires a small abstraction violation in
  MimeMultipart_ParseLine -- we have to check there if the entity is
  multipart/alternative and if so not notify emitters there because
  MimeMultipartAlternative_create_child handles it.

  - Jonathan Kamens, 2010-07-23

  When the option prefer_plaintext is on, the last text/plain part
  should be preferred over any other part that can be displayed. But
  if no text/plain part is found, then the algorithm should go as
  normal and convert any html part found to text. To achieve this I
  found that the simplest way was to change the function display_part_p
  into returning priority as an integer instead of boolean can/can't
  display. Then I also changed the function flush_children so it selects
  the last part with the highest priority. (Priority 0 means it cannot
  be displayed and the part is never chosen.)
